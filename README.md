### Hi there 👋 I'm Dimple!

I’m a Frontend-Focused Software Engineer who loves building fast, scalable, and user-friendly web applications using **React.js, Redux, JavaScript (ES6+)**, and **Java** on the backend.

I enjoy solving UI challenges, creating clean component architectures, and optimizing performance to make apps feel incredibly fast and responsive.

💡 What I work on:
- Modern React apps with reusable, scalable component systems  
- State management using Redux, Context API, and custom hooks  
- Performance tuning using React.memo, code splitting, lazy loading  
- Pixel-perfect, responsive UI/UX  
- Integrating React frontends with Java/Spring Boot APIs  
- Writing clean, maintainable, production-ready code  

⚙️ Technologies I enjoy:
**React.js | Redux | JavaScript ES6+ | HTML5 | CSS3 | Java | Spring Boot | REST APIs**

🌱 Currently improving:
- Advanced React patterns  
- UI performance optimization  
- Frontend architecture design  
- Design systems & component libraries
